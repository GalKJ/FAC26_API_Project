## Niete, Karol & Gareth web mashup project

[Cats, places or movies?](https://fac26.github.io/CatsDogsOrMovies/)

#### Our task  

To build an app that queries at least two APIs and uses the results to update the DOM. There should be a way for the user to search, filter, sort or otherwise affect what is displayed.

#### Cats, Movies or Places?

For this project we decided to build a website that invites the user to effect the data they receive âœ¨

#### Information for code review.

 1. Our latest changes have been merged into our main branch.
 2. Our main branch has been deployed using github pages https://fac26.github.io/CatsDogsOrMovies/
 3. Please feel free to clone our repo down to your local machine and open it in your prefered code editor.
 4. To view the website I personally use the vscode extension Live Server by Ritwick Dey which can be installed using the extensions panel in vscode.

#### Acceptance Criteria

* [x] Query at least two APIs using fetch
* [x] Dynamic content generated with JS
* [x] A clearly defined user journey, documented in your readme
* [ ] A responsive, mobile-first design ðŸ‘·
* [x] Ensure your app is accessible to as many different users as possible

#### API's
[The Movie DB](https://www.themoviedb.org/)<br>
[The Cat API](https://thecatapi.com/)<br>
[The Postcode API](https://api.postcodes.io/)<br>

#### User Journey's
* [x] Plan Project
* [x] Get Cat API Data - User should be able to look for GIFs and pictures for different breeds of cats.
* [x] Get Movie API Data - Users should be able look at the most popular films at the moment and make an informed decision about what to watch.
* [X] Get Postcode API Data - Users should be able to generate a random postcode and what can be found at that postcode to help plan a trip there.  
* [x] Plan Structure
* [ ] Complete Project

#### From Dogs to Postcodes

Initially I was going to use the Dog API https://dog.ceo/dog-api but after looking at the documentation I decided that the ways I could use the data would be to limited. Although Dog API provides many different endpoints I felt limited by arrays of dog breeds or images of breeds.

I decided to use the Postcode & Geo-location API for the UK https://postcodes.io/ as they offer many endpoints and the data is more complex, enabling me to create a user experience that is hopefully engaging, humorous and interesting.

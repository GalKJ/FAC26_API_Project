# Welcome to Cats,Dogs,Or Places?

## Niete,Karol & Gareth Web mashup project

### Our task - to build an app that queries at least two APIs and uses the results to update the DOM. There should be a way for the user to search, filter, sort or otherwise affect what is displayed.

#### Cats, Movies or Places?

For this project we decided to build a website that invites the user to effect the data they receive âœ¨

#### Information for code review.

    - Our latest changes have been merged into our main branch.
    - Our main branch has been deployed using github pages
    - Please feel free to clone our repo down to your local machine and open it in your prefered code editor.
    - To view the website I personally use the vscode extension Live Server by Ritwick Dey which can be installed using the extensions panel in vscode.
